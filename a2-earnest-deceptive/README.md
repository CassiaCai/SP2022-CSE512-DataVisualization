### Write-up

Question: How has income and income distribution of different racial groups in the U.S. changed from 1989 to 2019?

To answer this question, I use data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides income in 2020 dollars, adjusted using the CPI-U-RS. Upon closer inspection of the data file, I noticed that there were two surveys conducted in 2013 and 2017, where the survey questions were changed slightly. However, the value differences between the two surveys are small. For the purposes of data visualization, only data from the first survey of each year was used. In both my earnest and deceptive visualizations, I chose to display the income distribution for each racial group using stacked bars for each year. This then effectively shows us how the different income levels made up different proportions of the total. It also provides us with more greater detail by separating lower income (in two different shades of red) and higher income (in two different shades of green). For the income change over time, I used the same y-axis scale for the earnest visualization. For the deceptive visualization, I used different y-axis extents for the different group, showing that the income change pattern is similar. I also removed the first year and last year labels from the deceptive visualization. This is because if someone were to look really briefly my figure, they would see the shape and think that the income change in the 4 groups are very similar. This is obviously not the case (as can be seen in the earnest visualization). In the earnest visualization, the y-axis extents for all four groups are kept the same. This shows that the initial and final income values in 1989 and 2019 are drastically different for the different groups even if the shape of the income increase is similar. 

For the stacked bar graphs, I made the design choice to make the lower income ranges in red and the higher income ranges in green. This is because commonly, red is perceived as bad and green is perceived as good. In the earnest visualization, I made the middle-income bars grey (so that they are easily identified as part of the distribution). However, in the deceptive visualization, I made the middle-income bars white. The bars are there, but they are not evident. This then draws people's attention to the income extremes (high and low income ranges). This would mean that without careful viewing, information about the middle-income range is hard to grasp (or even notice). Essentially, I think that the two visualizations give different answers/highlight different needs. The earnest visualization says: there is a lot of racial disparity in income with some groups doing significantly better than others. For example, Asians, from 1989 to 2019, have had a much higher median income. The deceptive visualization says: tthere may be some disparities in how income is distributed within each racial group. However, all 4 groups have seen their median income increase in a similar way (for example, from 2014 onwards, there has been a general income increase seen in all 4 groups).
